/* Goal: Write a function which takes a full name as input 
and displays a string which shows the first name and last 
name separately

Example fullName: "Karmon Gibson"
Example fullName: "Andy Ho"

Hints given: Maybe use indexOf() to find the location of 
the SPACE character in the string? Can I use that to find 
the firsst and last name separately?

 0123456
"Andy Ho"

1. Write an empty function and name it 
"parseAndDisplayName".
2. Give the function a parameter named "fullName".
3. Use `let spacePosition = fullName.indexOf(" ")`
    - "index" is position/location of a character in a 
    string
4. Get the substring to the left of the spacePosition
    - Use a built-in string function to get the substring 
    starting at position (index) 0 up to but not including 
    the spacePosition.
    - Try `substring()` or `slice()`
    - Assign this substring to a variable named "lastName"
5. Get the substring to the right of the spacePosition 
    -  Use a built-in string function to get the substring 
    starting at the `spacePosition +1` up to the end of the 
    string.
    - Assign this substring to a variable name "lastName"
6. Use `console.log()` to display the first name and last 
name on the console.
    - Once working, consider displaying these on the PAGE 
    for the user, using innerHTML
